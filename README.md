ADOM Runner
---
This runner expects you own copy of ADOM from GOG.com  
The problem is ADOM is build on ubuntu 18.04 and cannot run on modern systems, so we can use docker^Wpodman to run the game  

PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED:
---
ALSA. I really couldn't run it with the sound. Perhaps there is a solution via pulseaudio magic, I didn't manage to find it.
